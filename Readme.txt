First I check the html file to see if there is an error in coding.
Then I fixed the link of the first Menu (Search Engine Optimization) in Navbar on the top of the page. 
I also add "atl" attribute to IMG tags of the page. 
I checked the <h> tags and changed by font size and add font type as well.
I like the right column of the page if it is a bit shorter and match the height with the right one, so I changed the Margins and Height in some part of it.
I also changed the footer text size.
I add the proper Title for a page to get a better search engine results based on search.
I add <section> to the right side of the page and define it in css
I add <aside> to the right side of the page and define it in css
